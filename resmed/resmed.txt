how to use ssh to redirecting connection?

>> ssh -R 31635:wres24057:8899 au3rdcmod01

will ssh to au3rdcmod01, and connection to 31635 will be redirected to the wres24057:8899.So that you can make your own web browser on wres24057.


you can use this ssh redirecting connection to just use a port for both HAT and Apache.
As port open for public may be running out, we need to share public port for Apachea and HAT
