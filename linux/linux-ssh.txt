 :command
  ssh -N -p 22 bob@mylinuxserver.xxx -L 2110:localhost:110
  Where:
  -N
  = Do not execute a remote command
  -p 22
  = External SSH port 22. I tend to use other external SSH ports to keep skript kiddies from hitting my home SSH server. It seems not necessary.
  bob@mylinuxserver.xxx
  = username@hostname(or ip address)
  -L 2110/localhost/110
  = Bind information. Broken down as such: client-port:hostname:hostport - In this example your binding POP3 on the server to your localhost port 2110
