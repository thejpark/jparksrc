Design

1. bad ip checking
- what is bad ip?
- ac/uc?
  
- a) collect access log from each web server and send it to centralised server to analyze
     - pros: analyse locally and minimise network traffic
     - cons: if server is down then we may lost some information
       client (webserver) and log analyse server should synchronise. So each message may have
       a tag representing which timeframe it is for. It may use/send more bytes to network
     - web server need to rotate access log? if log is small then memory double buffer? 
  b) send log as they created to the centralised server
     - pros: each webserver can just udp send msg(containing ip) to server, server can take
             care of the rest
     - cons: network overhead, need more powerful server? 
     - do not need to store at access log but just send from memory to network

- which network protocol to use?
  tcp:
     - pros
     - cons
  udp (or multicasting):
     - pros
     - cons
